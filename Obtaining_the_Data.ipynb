        "Data pertaining to the time, location, and content of thousands of 311 calls in New York City is recorded every day. By studying trends in this data, government agencies can respond more effectively to non-emergency requests and issues raised by the populations they serve. Using public data on 311 calls and community districts in NYC, this project explores which types of calls are the most common, how daily call volume varies across different districts, and how calls are distributed to various responding government agencies. Using natural language processing and the Keras library, this project aims to develop a neural network that can classify the government agency that responded to a call, given the call's description as an input. The best-performing model correctly classified 73% of calls in a test subset of the data. The agency variable was heavily imbalanced: the New York Police Department (NYPD) responded to just over 50% of all 311 calls. There were 14 total government agencies to which 311 calls in the dataset were assigned, which presents difficulties in training a classifier with perfect accuracy. Currently, most non-emergency service requests are handled through a phone call. This type of classifier, if developed further, could facilitate the automatic assigment of non-emergency requests to the appropriate agency in an online context where requests generate text descriptions.\n"
