# An Analysis of NYC 311 Service Requests 
## Predicting the Responding Government Agency

**Authors**: Avonlea Fisher

The contents of this repository detail an analysis of NYC 311 Service requests and the community districts in which they were recorded. 

### Problem:

Understanding trends in 311 data can help government agencies more effectively respond to requests and issues raised by the populations they serve. The exploratory analysis section of this project seeks to identify such trends, and the modelling section aims to build a classifier that can accurately predict the agency that responds to a call. This type of classification could facilitate the automatic assigment of non-emergency requests to the appropriate agency, in a context where requests generate text descriptions.
